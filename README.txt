NAME : pyPLUTO 

TASK : Quick Tool for Visualization of PLUTO code [Mignone 2007] data

AUTHORS : Bhargav Vaidya [University of Leeds/MPI Astronomy, Heidelberg]
Denis Stepanovs [MPI Astronomy, Heidelberg] 

DESCRIPTION:
The code is completely written using the Python Language. 
Further the GUI is developed with the Tkinter Interface.


Features of this code: 

1. Completely based on Python and easy to work without need of any licenses
like in IDL. 
2. The GUI environment provides a tool for quick-check of data during the
simulations runs. 
3. The code is user friendly and allows the user to even do further plotting
of contours, velocity vectors
on the surface plot.
4. Also the code can read the saved user defined variables. 

Limitations:

1. Only 2D views are available for 3D data. 
2. The code up-till now only has visualization tools for static data. 
The AMR data can not be viewed with the same. 

MANUAL :
Further details of the Installation and Getting Started can be found in the
pyPLUTO.pdf  attached with this code in the doc/latex folder.
